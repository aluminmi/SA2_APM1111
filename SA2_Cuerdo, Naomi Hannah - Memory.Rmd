# Introduction

This report examines the effects of Alzhimer's Disease (AD) status and drug treatment on training errors. Training errors were measured as the number of errors committed during a training session, recorded on a continuous scale. The independent variables included:

*- AD Status*: Categorized as "With AD" (coded as 1) and "Without AD" (coded as 2)

*- Treatment*: Drug treatment type categorized into four groups: "A" (coded as 1), "B" (coded as 2), "C" (coded as 3), and "D" (coded as 4)

Furthermore, this analysis explores the interaction between AD status and treatment type to understand their combined influence on training performance. 

# Method 

## Participants
The dataset consisted of a sample of experimental subjects assigned to two AD status groups and four treatment groups. The dependent variable was *memory day errors*, measured as a continuous variable representing task performance.

## Procedure
Memory Day errors were analyzed using a two-way (2B) ANOVA with two between-subject factors: AD status and treatment. This statistical method was chosen to assess the main effects of AD status and treatment, as well as their interaction effect, on training errors. 

Below are the assumptions:

Below are the assumptions:
*Assumption 1.* The dependent variable (memory day errors) is measured at the continuous level.
*Assumption 2.* The two independent variables (AD Status and Treatment) consists of two or more categorical independent groups. The AD Status is the dichotomous variable, whereas the Treatment is the polytomous variable.
*Assumption 3.* The independence of observations among each group of the independent variable or between the group themselves is observed.
*Assumption 4.* There should be no significant outliers in any cell of the design.
*Assumption 5.* The distribution of the dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed in every cell of the design.
*Assumption 6.* The variance of the dependent variable should be equal in every cell of the design.

## Hypothesis

**1.Main Effect on AD Status**

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in memory day scores between individuals with AD and those without AD.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in memory day scores between individuals with AD and those without AD.

**2.Main Effect on Treatment**

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no difference in memory day across different treatment groups.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant difference in memory day between at least two treatment groups.

**3.Interaction Effect between AD Status and Treatment**

Null Hypothesis (H₀): There is no interaction between AD status and treatment type in their effect on memory day scores. The effect of treatment is the same for individuals with and without AD.

Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): There is a significant main interaction effect on AD Status and treatment type on memory day scores.

# Descriptive Analysis
```{r data head}

head(data)

```

```{r summary }
summary(data)

```

```{r std}
standard_dev <- sd(data$Memory, na.rm = TRUE)
print(sprintf("St dev: %.2f", standard_dev))

```
The dataset included 20 participants identified as "With AD" (coded as 1) and 20 as "Without AD" (coded as 2). There were 10 participants in each of the 4 treatment groups (1, 2, 3, 4)

The dependent variable, *Training Errors*, was measured on a continuous scale, with values ranging from 12 to 18 errors. The *mean* number of errors was ***M=9.925***, with a ***standard deviation (SD) = 2.74.***

***Thus, Assumptions 1 and 2 was achieved.***

```{r}
aggregate(Memory ~ AD_Status + Treatment, data = data, FUN = base::mean)
```

The table above indicates that *Memory Scores* vary across combinations of AD_Status and Treatment. Individuals with *AD (AD_Status = 1)* and *Treatment 2* reported the highest mean training scores *(M = 13.2)*, while individuals without AD *(AD_Status = 2)* in Treatment 4 reported the lowest mean scores *(M = 6.6)*.

Therefore, there is no overlap or duplication in data points within groups.

***Assumption 3 (independence of observations) was achieved.***

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = AD_Status, y = Memory, fill = Treatment)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Memory Errors by AD Status and Treatment")
```
Given that there is one outlier around treatment 2, we shall check if this significantly affects the dataset.

```{r}
Q1 <- quantile(data$Memory, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE)  
Q3 <- quantile(data$Memory, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)  
IQR_value <- Q3 - Q1                            

# Define lower and upper bounds
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR_value
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR_value

# Identify potential outliers
outliers <- data %>%
  filter(Memory < lower_bound | Memory > upper_bound)

# Display results
cat("Lower Bound:", lower_bound, "\n")
cat("Upper Bound:", upper_bound, "\n")
print(outliers)
```

Given that from the IQR, it showed that there are zero rows, this indicates that the outliers from the graph does not significantly affect the results. 

***assumption 4 was achieved***

```{r}
model <- aov(Memory ~ AD_Status + Treatment, data = data,)
shapiro.test(residuals(model))
```

```{r}
shapiro_results_memory <- data %>%
  group_by(AD_Status, Treatment) %>%
  summarise(
    shapiro_stat = shapiro.test(Memory)$statistic,
    p_value = shapiro.test(Memory)$p.value
  )
print(shapiro_results_memory)
```


The Shapiro-Wilk test indicated a deviation from normality in one group (𝑊=0.77,𝑝=
0.046). However, given that ANOVA is robust to such violations with moderate-to-large sample sizes, the analysis was conducted with caution.

***Assumption 5 was achieved with caution***


```{r}
leveneTest(Memory ~ AD_Status * Treatment, data = data)
```

From the table above, the training scores across the
independent variables show similar levels of variability (***F*** = 0.83, ***p*** \> .05). This means that the variances (or spread) of the training scores are *equal across the groups*. Because the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we *fail* to reject the null hypothesis that the variances are equal.

***Assumption 6 was achieved***

# Inferential Analysis

## Two-Way (2B) ANOVA

Now that all assumptions were checked, we can now proceed with the ANOVA Analysis.

```{r}
anova_memory <- aov(Memory ~ AD_Status * Treatment, data = data)
summary(anova_memory)
```
From the table, it seems that there are no significant effects in Memory Errors and AD Status
F(1,32)=75.31,p<0.001). Since there are no significant effects on Memory Day Errors for these factors, conducting post hoc tests would not provide meaningful results. 

# APA Report
A two-way ANOVA was conducted to examine the effects of *AD Status* and *Treatment* on *memory errors*. Assumptions of normality and homogenity of variance were evaluated. The Shapiro-Wilk test for normality showed mixed results: for some groups, the residuals were normally distributed *(e.g., Treatment 1, AD Status 1, p = 0.08).* However, Levene’s test for homogeneity of variance was non-significant, indicating that the variances were equal across the groups *(F(7, 32) = 2.21, p = 0.07)*, suggesting that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was met.

Results revealed that there is a statistically significant main effect of AD Status on memory errors, *F(1, 32) = 75.31, p < 0.001, η² = 0.70*, indicating that individuals with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) made significantly more memory errors compared to those without AD.

However, there was no significant main effect of Treatment on memory errors, *F(3, 32) = 1.92, p = 0.146,* suggesting that the different treatment groups did not significantly affect memory errors. Additionally, the interaction between AD Status and Treatment was not significant, *F(3, 32) = 1.15, p = 0.344,* indicating that the effect of treatment on memory errors did not differ based on AD status.
